3rd year student at Lviv Polytechnic National University studying Software Engineering. 

As of February 2026, I am in France as part of my Erasmus+ exchange.

Passionate about all kinds of algorithms (procedural generation, chess, board games, graphics) and like to unusual stuff from scratch without having to rely on external libraries.
